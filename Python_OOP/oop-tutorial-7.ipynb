    "## Composition\n",
    "In this tutorial we will use composition to create a more complex class from other classes. By using the class name or by creating the object we can access instances of one class inside another class. A class *Composite* contains objects of another class *Component*. This type of relationship is known as *Has-A* relation between classes. In our example we are going to create a class called Vehicle that contains an object from the class Owner and one from the class Ride."
